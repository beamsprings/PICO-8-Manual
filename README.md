# PICO-8-Manual
A formatting of the PICO-8 Manual; starting from v0.2.0h.
Made with Bean for macOS; there are three files available for download:
a .bean file, a .rtfd file,and a finished PDF in both colour and B&W.

This is a very crude Git page, I know, but its sole intent is to provide me a way to keep track of formatting issues and missing documentation, so if you find an error or a slip of the keyboard feel free to open an issue.
